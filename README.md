# Deque project

----------------

## Idea of implementation

* Deque implemented as map of Data Nodes
* Deque remembers in its variable if it is inverted. This variable is given to Data Nodes and this is being implemented on Data Node level
* Inverted Deque has also pointer to regular Deque so variables can change for both when one variable changes them

## Time needed

### Thinking

* about 1 hour

### Implementation

* about 2 days
